# Website-Category-Prediction
Problem Definition: Letâ€™s say we have to categorize web pages. Typically theys can be categorized under four heads: - E-commerce page (like Amazon) - Listing page (like naukri, zomato etc) - Article (landing page , Blogs) - Video / images pages (YouTube etc)  Devise a function in which input is a URL and output is a prediction (predicting the input URL to be one of the above categories) Feel free to use any existing platform / API / Ml model etc.
